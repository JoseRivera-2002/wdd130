        <p>Hi, I am José Ignacio and I'm from La Paz, Bolivia. I'm 22 years old and I just started Web and Computer Development on BYU. I feel excited about the path I have ahead
            and the thigs I'm going to learn. My goal this block is to grow personaly, to enhance my knowledge about coding, and prepare for my next job as good as I can. In
            the future I want to be an expert programer who uses his skills to help people, help and protect organizations (cybersecurity) and inspire others to follow this
            exciting and wide field.
